# **The almost final countdown (ReactJS)**


This is a timer challenge game where, players must start and stop the timers before the specified amount of time runs out. This was a practice project I had to complete for the React course as part of my learning process. Building it was got a bit confusing at time managing all the time functions and passing props back and fought but it was enjoyable and fun to build. I learned a lot about using Components, State, Refs, Portals and more of React best practices and concepts.


***What I learnt ðŸ“š***
------------------------
****Refs and Portals****

Advanced DOM Access and Value Management

Here are some of the things I learn during this section of my React journey:

 * Accessing DOM elements with Refs
 * Managing values with Refs
 * Exposing API functions from Components
 * Detaching DOM rendering from JSX structures with Portals


***How can it be improved?***
------------------------------
The project can be improved by implementing a single player mode, so that user can player against the computer. So effects or background music can also be an additional features.


  ***Technologies Used***
------------------------

  * React
  * JavaScript
  * HTML
  * CSS
